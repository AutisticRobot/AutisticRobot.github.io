          <h2>Month 10</h2>
          <h4>January 1st, 2024</h4>
          <p>Happy New Year!! Last month, instead of working on the engine, I attempted the Advent of Code 2023 event.</p>
          <p>I only got to day 6 by the end of the month, but that's better than last year! anyway, my overall goal</p>
          <p>for this year ot to fully make a game and release it on steam. So if you want to follow development</p>
          <p>the source code is public on my Github, where it will always be, even after release. The game will</p>
          <p>be sold for $5 at release, which is why the Github repo will not include a complied version of the code.</p>
          <p>though you are free to compile it yourself to save the $5 cost. If the game is ever released, it will</p>
          <p>be out on January 1st, 2025.</p>

          <h2>Month 9</h2>
          <h4>December 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>This month I worked on the engine some more, it's not yet ready, but it's better to take my time to get the</p>
          <p>engine ready, than to rush it and have to scrap it. curently I am working on the basic node that all other</p>
          <p>game objects are based on, along with the code infrastucture in the rest of the engine to be able to give</p>
          <p>the differents types of nodes their basic functionality.</p>

          <h2>Month 8</h2>
          <h4>November 7th, 2023</h4>
          <p>This month's devlog took a little longer because I forgot, as I was focusing on some life stuff that was coming</p>
          <p>to a point over halloween. Over the month since the last devlog, I have been working on the game engine a little.</p>
          <p>while it has been moving along steadily, but over the next month I need to need to work on getting it to the point</p>
          <p>of being able o star work on the main peices of game specific code.</p>

          <h2>Month 7</h2>
          <h4>October 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>Last month I decided to remake my game engine from scratch in a different language. At first I thought</p>
          <p>it might be worth a try to make it in rust so thaat I could learn the language, I still have not gotten the compiler to work.</p>
          <p>So I have been making the engine in C++, and it has been going well. The latest thing I am working on in the engine</p>
          <p>is a Vector2 implamentation as the ones in C== by default, and in SFML, the OpenGL API that I am using, dont work</p>
          <p>in the way that I need them too. and in that process, I am learning templates and operator overloading.</p>

        <div class="post">
          <h2>Month 6</h2>
          <h4>September 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>This has been a long month. First off, I have not completed my goal for a couple of reasons. The first reason being</p>
          <p>that my aunt asked for me to make her a program for her work, that prototype took 2 weeks. The other reason was</p>
          <p>that I realised that I findd writting code a lot more than the ammount of level design needed to test different</p>
          <p>gameplay. Today I decited to pick back up the game engine that I was working on years ago, but now in c++.</p>
          <p>I wanted to pick the engine back up because it is a lot of just code that I can just grind out without having</p>
          <p>to spend 5 hours at least per session to be able to add anything. I need to be able to work on it for about 20 minutes</p>
          <p>at a time as I am curently doing this as a hobby so I dont have all that much time to work on it  all at once.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>Month 5</h2>
          <h4>August 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>At the begining of the month I unshure of what to work on, but I eventuialy decided on a RC car game. I've had</p>
          <p>the idea for this game for a long time, as it is a game I have wanted to play since before I got into programing.</p>
          <p>The idea for the game is pretty simple, as I am sill unshure of what the game play will be exactly. I know I want</p>
          <p>there to be a lot of secret tunnles and passageways in a normal sized world for you to eplore. The issue being</p>
          <p>that I am not yet shure on how I am going to incentivise the player to go out and explore, though I will likley</p>
          <p>figure that out when I actuialy start throwing random stuff in to see what sticks. I also want to set a goal</p>
          <p>for the upcoming month as I think I will need the more clear feedback. The goal for the month of August for me</p>
          <p>will be: to get the main gameplay loop figured out, and make some graphics for the game.</p>

          <h2>Month 4</h2>
          <h4>July 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>This month I worked on a game I call "Keyboard Tester Game". The name subtilty hints at the fact it</p>
          <p>made to make testing a lot of keyboards at once, a little less boring. Though, today I decited to stop</p>
          <p>working on it because I have lost interest, and the code has gotten pretty bad and needs a good rewrite.</p></div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>Month 3</h2>
          <h4>June 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>This month I worked on the game some more. now, the AI has the ability to walk to a random location</p>
          <p>within it's range in a loop, I also added a gun, but it's bullets do nothing.</p>
          <p>Though it has a cool effect when you shoot a lot of bullets.</p>

        <div class="post">
          <h2>Month 2</h2>
          <h4>March 1st, 2023</h4>
          <p>I starrted this month working on this website, before going to work on a game I am makeing with a friend.</p>
          <p>I will talk about it more when it is ready. Right now I am working on figuring out how the AI will work.</p>

        I started work on this in late January on my school chromebook because I couldn't download <br>
        anything to help with makeing games, so I made this to run a html file so there is no <br>
